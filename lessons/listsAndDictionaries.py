# we could put PIDs in a list, but that would require an obscene # of unused indices
# DICTIONARIES!
# Dictionaries, like lists, are a data structure
# Unlike lists, dictionaries give you the ability
# to decide how what to index your data by.
# Lists: always zero-based, sequential,
# integer indices!
# Dictionaries are indexed by keys
# associated with values. This is a unique,
# one-way mapping!
# Analogous: A real-world dictionaryâ€™s
# keys are words and associated values
# are definitions.
